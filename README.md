# What is this
This is a project to make a fully functional discord bot that is only 1 line. 
# Rules
NO semi-colons
NO IDEs except github
NO eval or new Function
NO autocomplete
NO separating the line into multiple lines, but word wrapping is tolerated
NO modules other than native node ones ( ie. fs, path, http ) and discord.js
1 single file, 1 single line.
